# NDTV_Weather_API_Test
This project captures the Temp from UI and API, compares the same using the variance 


#Pre Requisite
  Java is installed and configured on the system 
  confirm by typing java –version on CMD prompt  
  Maven is installed and configured on the system
  confirm by typing mvn –version on CMD prompt

  RestAssured is used to send API requests 
  Selenium with Java is used to perform operations on UI

#Steps to run the project
  Unzip the folder to any location
  
  Open CMD prompt, CD to the folder extracted above
  
  Run the following command 
  
  mvn clean test -DsuiteXMLFile=testng.xml  


  The variance for temperature difference set is as 10 
  The results with failures (Differences is greater than variance (10) 
  Difference between the temp_UI (captured on UI) and (temp_API captured using API)


# Description of files
  ##MyLogger: Log all the activities
  ##Evidences Captured

  ###Screenshots – Evidences captured for all cities

  ###JSON_Resp – JSON response captured for each city

  ##APIUtils: All methods to fetch Response, Status Code, Status Line, Response Header, etc

  ##Utilities:
  ###Common utilities to tskeScreenShot, Select Value from list, Select value from Drop Down, Actions like Move to, Mouse Hover etc
  
  ###Constants: maintain the values for URL, ApiKey, paths etc
  ##Utils to convert temperature


# Tests Added
  Capture all Cities
  
  Uncheck all cities on Pin your City List
  
  UI (tempUI) Temperature 
  
    Find the city on Pin your City

    Check the city

    Store  the temperature in Degree C and F – Capture the screenshot
  
  API (tempAPI) Temperature
      
      *Get the JSON response for City above – Store the JSON Response 
      
      *Get the temp in K from the JSON response	
      
      *Convert temperature from Degree K to C
  
  Find the difference (should not exceed the variance – set to 10)
  
    *Compare tempUI and tempAPI, if the difference exceeds 10 – mark the test as Fail and attach the screen shot captured



# ToDo

  Capture the results in Excel sheet
  
  Convert the test in BDD 
  
  Add a utility to email the report
  
  Run the test on different browsers
  
  Supply the data from excel sheet if required
  
  Email the report with evidences
  
  Integrate with ANT and CI
